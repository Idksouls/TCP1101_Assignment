## Problems Encountered & Solutions

Describe the problems encountered and provide the solutions / plan for the solutions.

1. Quit game function not working as intended. We modified the quitCommand function into an if else loop as a solution.
2. Alien movement can't be implement because it will run away from the board. So the solution for it was to remove the movement.
